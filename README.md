# Music box

I developed an application called Music box using Django and Bootstrap. In this application, the user is able to perform the CRUD of Albums and Artists and still link to each other. You can also view recently added albums and a top five of artists who have added more albums. This system was developed using Class-Based Views and it is hosted on Heroku at the link [Music box](https://musicbox-kelyanne.herokuapp.com/ "Music box")

Note: Heroku runs your application on dynos and dynos go to sleep after 30 minutes if there is not request comes, this makes Heroku not preserve user upload media files between dynos restart.
